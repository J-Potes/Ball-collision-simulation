# Ball-collision-simulation

Hello everyone, this was an assigment for Simulation class. The objective was to create a simulation of balls in a container, the balls appear periodically 
in a time interval. Besides that,  there is a hexagon with a movement restriction, it can only move in the X-axis. 
In the bottom left part of the container there is a section that increase the speed of the balls when they collide with it.

It needs pygame and OpenGL.

In the current version, most of the code is written in Spanish.
